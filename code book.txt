=========

Subject -> An integer from 1 to 30 which represents the specific test subject that the measurement was taken for.

Activity -> A character factor which labels the type of activity being measured. The types of activity are "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING" and "LAYING"

The further columns contain the measurement means. They have labels of the form FEATURE-FUNCTION-DIMENSION(if relevant). The explanation of what the features are is explained in an extract from an explanation file in the original data below*. The function is either mean() representing mean and std() representing standard deviation.

Each column is the mean of all measurements of the named feature for the pair of Subject and Activity given in the first two columns of that row. For example, the tBodyAcc-std()-X value for Subject 1 and the Activity "SITTING" would be the mean of all standard deviations for measurements of the tBody feature in the X direction while Subject 1 was sitting.

The excerpt explaining the feature names follows:

*Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
